\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:conclusion}
We present the first systematic study of SLMs for NLQ-to-KQL translation, introducing prompting enhancements, LoRA fine-tuning with rationale distillation, and a two-stage SLM–Oracle architecture. Our approach achieves near-LLM accuracy at up to 15× lower cost, demonstrating SLMs as a practical, scalable alternative for enterprise security analytics.
